This script is extensive and serves as a complete pipeline for managing, processing, and extracting data from Excel files, particularly related to clients and procedures. Here's how it works and how to integrate it effectively:

Main Features:
Client and Procedure Management:

Predefined lists of clients and procedures.
Ability to add, edit, and remove clients and procedures via the GUI.
Support for loading additional clients and procedures from TXT files.
Excel File Processing:

Identifies blocks of colored cells (red and blue).
Extracts data like client names, procedures, payment forms, and other attributes from these blocks.
Handles merged cells and various formatting issues in Excel files.
Data Extraction:

Extracts detailed information like phone numbers, payment forms, and vouchers.
Uses pattern matching and approximate string matching for robust data extraction.
User Interface:

Built with tkinter for ease of use.
Buttons for selecting files, managing clients/procedures, and processing spreadsheets.
Integration:
To integrate or use this script:

Setup:

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed: openpyxl, rapidfuzz, tkinter.
Install them using pip if not already installed:
bash
Copiar c√≥digo
pip install openpyxl rapidfuzz
Run the Script:

Save the script as a .py file.
Execute it in your Python environment.
Usage:

Launch the GUI.
Use the provided buttons to load or manage clients/procedures.
Select an Excel file to process.
Output:

The script saves a new Excel file with the processed data appended to the original file name (e.g., -resultado.xlsx).
Custom Adjustments:

Modify predefined client or procedure lists directly in the script.
Change any default values or behaviors (e.g., cell colors or separators).
Example Workflow:
Launch the script.
Add additional clients or procedures using TXT files or manual input.
Select an Excel file to process.
Review the resulting Excel file with all extracted and processed data.
This script is robust but may need additional adjustments depending on specific file formats or use cases.
